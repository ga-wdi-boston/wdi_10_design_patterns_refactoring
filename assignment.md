# Refactoring Assignment

* Possible targets for this assignment: Project 1, Project 2, your Todo app, or your Hacker News clone.
* Find an area of code in need of refactoring. Identify the specific code smells it suffers from, or design patterns it violates.
* Identify specific refactorings that will fix the code smell or address the violation, and execute them.
* Make a commit and push it to GitHub. Leave a comment on that specific commit explaining all of the things you identified above (code smells, design patterns, refactorings used).

**Do the above three times!** Try not to use the same project or the same code smells every time. Some of your code smells should be something other than "Duplicated Code", "Long Method", or "Large Class".

Note if you are working on your Project 2, do your refactoring in a uniquely-named branch. Do not make a pull request for this branch or merge it into master &ndash; the idea here is to allow your teammates to do the same refactorings independently without conflicts occurring.

When finished, leave a comment on the current open issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/wdi_10_design_patterns_refactoring/issues), linking to each of your three commits on GitHub.
